  abstract = {Michotte's theory of ampliation suggests that causal relationships are perceived by objects animated under appropriate spatiotemporal conditions. We extend the theory of ampliation and propose that the immediate perception of complex causal relations is also dependent on a set of structural and temporal rules. We designed animated representations, based on Michotte's rules, for showing complex causal relationships or causal semantics. In this paper we describe a set of animations for showing semantics such as causal amplification, causal strength, causal dampening, and causal multiplicity. In a two part study we compared the effectiveness of both the static and animated representations. The first study (N=44) asked participants to recall passages that were previously displayed using both types of representations. Participants were 8\% more accurate in recalling causal semantics when they were presented using animations instead of static graphs. In the second study (N=112) we evaluated the intuitiveness of the representations. Our results showed that while users were as accurate with the static graphs as with the animations, they were 9\% faster in matching the correct causal statements in the animated condition. Overall our results show that animated diagrams that are designed based on perceptual rules such as those proposed by Michotte have the potential to facilitate comprehension of complex causal relations.},

For example, cross-ﬁltering dynamically updates linked visualizations based on the user’s continuous brushing actions. The animated eﬀects resulting from these interactions depends both on how interaction (e.g., brushing speed) controls properties of the animation such as frame rate, as well as how the data that is being explored dictates the data encoded in the animation. Past work has found that frame rate matters to general perception, however a critical question is which of these animation and data properties aﬀects the perceptual accuracy of judgement tasks, and to what extent. Although graphical perception has been well studied for static data visualizations, it is ripe for exploration in the animated setting. We designed two animated judgment tasks of a target bar in an animated bar chart and empirically evaluate the eﬀects of 2 animations properties—highlighting of the target bar and frame rate—as well as 3 data properties that aﬀect the target bar’s value throughout the animation. In short, we ﬁnd that the rate and timing of animation changes is easier detected in larger values; that encodings such as color are easier to detect than shapes; and that timing is important—earlier changes were harder to perceive as compared to later changes in the animation. Our results are an initial step to understanding perceptual accuracy for animated data visualizations, both for presentations and ultimately as part of interactive applications.},

  abstract = {User engagement (UE) and its measurement have been of increasing interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). The User Engagement Scale (UES) is one tool developed to measure UE, and has been used in a variety of digital domains. The original UES consisted of 31-items and purported to measure six dimensions of engagement: aesthetic appeal, focused attention, novelty, perceived usability, felt involvement, and endurability. A recent synthesis of the literature questioned the original six-factors. Further, the ways in which the UES has been implemented in studies suggests there may be a need for a briefer version of the questionnaire and more eﬀective documentation to guide its use and analysis. This research investigated and veriﬁed a four-factor structure of the UES and proposed a Short Form (SF). We employed contemporary statistical tools that were unavailable during the UES’ development to re-analyze the original data, consisting of 427 and 779 valid responses across two studies, and examined new data (N=344) gathered as part of a three-year digital library project. In this paper we detail our analyses, present a revised long and short form (SF) version of the UES, and oﬀer guidance for researchers interested in adopting the UES and UES-SF in their own studies.},

  abstract = {Animated transition has been a popular design choice for smoothly switching between different visualization views or layouts, in which movement trajectories are created as cues for tracking objects during location shifting. Tracking moving objects, however, becomes difﬁcult when their movement paths overlap or the number of tracking targets increases. We propose a novel design to facilitate tracking moving objects in animated transitions. Instead of simply animating an object along a straight line, we create “bundled” movement trajectories for a group of objects that have spatial proximity and share similar moving directions. To study the effect of bundled trajectories, we untangle variations due to different aspects of tracking complexity in a comprehensive controlled user study. The results indicate that using bundled trajectories is particularly effective when tracking more targets (six vs. three targets) or when the object movement involves a high degree of occlusion or deformation. Based on the study, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the new technique, as well as provide design implications.},

Visualizing data streams (e. g., Tweets, RSS, Emails) is challenging as incoming data arrive at unpredictable rates and have to remain readable. For data streams, clearly expressing chronological order while avoiding clutter, and keeping aging data visible, are important. The metaphor is drawn from the real-world sedimentation processes: objects fall due to gravity, and aggregate into strata over time. Inspired by this metaphor, data is visually depicted as falling objects using a force model to land on a surface, aggregating into strata over time. In this paper, we discuss how this metaphor addresses the speciﬁc challenge of smoothing the transition between incoming and aging data. We describe the metaphor’s design space, a toolkit developed to facilitate its implementation, and example applications to a range of case studies. We then explore the generative capabilities of the design space through our toolkit. We ﬁnally illustrate creative extensions of the metaphor when applied to real streams of data.},

The existing evaluations of designs that facilitate these comparisons tend to be based on intuitive reasoning, rather than quantifiable measures. We build on this work with a series of crowdsourced experiments that use low-level perceptual comparison tasks that arise frequently in comparisons within data visualizations (e.g., which value changes the most between the two sets of data?). Participants completed these tasks across a variety of layouts: overlaid, two arrangements of juxtaposed small multiples, mirror-symmetric small multiples, and animated transitions. A staircase procedure sought the difficulty level (e.g., value change delta) that led to equivalent accuracy for each layout. Confirming prior intuition, we observe high levels of performance for overlaid versus standard small multiples. However, we also find performance improvements for both mirror symmetric small multiples and animated transitions. While some results are incongruent with common wisdom in data visualization, they align with previous work in perceptual psychology, and thus have potentially strong implications for visual comparison designs.},

The resulting grammar is called Atom, and is based on passing data through a series of layout operations that divide the output of previous operations recursively until the size and position of every data point can be determined.

We present design rationales for animated transitions depicting aggregate operations and present the results of an experiment assessing the impact of these different transitions on identiﬁcation tasks. We ﬁnd that judiciously staged animated transitions can improve subjects’ accuracy at identifying the aggregation performed, though sometimes with longer response times than with static transitions. Through an analysis of participants’ rankings and qualitative responses, we ﬁnd a consistent preference for animation over static transitions and highlight visual features subjects report relying on to make their judgments. We conclude by extending our animation designs to more complex charts of aggregated data such as box plots and bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals.},

We use quantitative content analysis to systematically survey examples of visual analytics systems and enumerate the use of these design factors in data summarization. Through this analysis, we expose the relationship between design considerations, strategies for data summarization in visualization systems, and how different summarization methods inﬂuence the analyses supported by systems. We use these results to synthesize common patterns in real-world use of summary visualizations and highlight open challenges and opportunities that these patterns offer for designing effective systems.

In this paper, we introduce animated transition design, a technique to build smooth, non-linear transitions for clustered data with either minimal or no user involvement. The technique is flexible and simple to implement, and has the additional advantage that it explicitly enhances coordinated motion and can avoid crowding, which are both important factors to support object tracking in a scene. We investigate its usability, provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of this technique through metric evaluations and user study and discuss limitations and future directions.},

Narvis targets two types of end users: teachers, experts in data visualization who produce tutorials for explaining a data visualization, and students, non-experts who try to understand visualization designs through tutorials. We present an analysis of requirements through close discussions with the two types of end users. The resulting considerations guide the design and implementation of Narvis. Additionally, to help teachers better organize their introduction slideshows, we specify a data visualization as a hierarchical combination of components, which are automatically detected and extracted by Narvis. The teachers craft an introduction slideshow through ﬁrst organizing these components, and then explaining them sequentially. A series of templates are provided for adding annotations and animations to improve efﬁciency during the authoring process.

  abstract = {Storytelling with data is becoming an important component of many ﬁelds such as graphic design, the advocacy of causes, and journalism. New techniques for integrating data visualization into narrative stories have now become commonplace. Authors are enabling new reader experiences, such as linking textual narrative and data visualizations through dynamic queries embedded in the text. Novel means of communicating position and navigating within the narrative also have emerged, such as utilizing scrolling to advance narration and initiate animations. We advance the study of narrative visualization through an analysis of a curated collection of recent data-driven stories shared on the web. Drawing from the results of this analysis, we present a set of techniques being employed in these examples, organized under four high-level categories that help authors to tell stories in creative ways: communicating narrative and explaining data, linking separated story elements, enhancing structure and navigation, and providing controlled exploration. We describe the beneﬁts of each storytelling technique along with a number of example applications of the ideas through recent data-driven stories. Additionally, we discuss the trends we observed as well as how the ﬁeld has evolved and grown. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of areas for future research.},

We gave crowdworkers i) abstract information visualization tasks without any context, ii) tasks where we added semantics to the dataset, and iii) tasks with two types of backstory narratives: an analytic narrative and a decision-making narrative. Contrary to our expectations, we did not ﬁnd evidence that adding data semantics increases accuracy, and further found that our backstory narratives can even decrease accuracy. Adding dataset semantics can however increase attention and provide subjective beneﬁts in terms of conﬁdence, perceived easiness, task enjoyability and perceived usefulness of the visualization. Nevertheless, our backstory narratives did not appear to provide additional subjective beneﬁts. These preliminary ﬁndings suggest that narratives may have complex and unanticipated effects, calling for more studies in this area.},

In the ﬁeld of visualization, storytelling is rapidly gaining momentum and evolving cutting-edge techniques that enhance understanding. Many communities have commented on the importance of storytelling in data visualization. Storytellers tend to be integrating complex visualizations into their narratives in growing numbers. In this paper, we present a survey of storytelling literature in visualization and present an overview of the common and important elements in storytelling visualization. We also describe the challenges in this ﬁeld as well as a novel classiﬁcation of the literature on storytelling in visualization. Our classiﬁcation scheme highlights the open and unsolved problems in this ﬁeld as well as the more mature storytelling sub-ﬁelds. The beneﬁts offer a concise overview and a starting point into this rapidly evolving research trend and provide a deeper understanding of this topic.},

  shorttitle = {The Limits of Time and Transitions},
  abstract = {The juxtaposition of two images often produces the illusory sense of time passing, as found in the visual language used in modern comic books, which creates the sense that this linear sequence presents a succession of moments or temporal units. Author and theorist Scott McCloud took this view to an extreme, proposing that sequential images are guided by a notion that ‘time = space’ (McCloud 2000), because this temporal passage occurs on a spatial surface. To McCloud, this ‘temporal mapping’ results in a movement of time with a movement of space. This sense of temporality, then, is the ‘essence’ of comics, which is manifested in McCloud’s taxonomy of transitions of panel-to-panel relationships (McCloud 1993). While less specific, this same type of ‘essence’ of connection can be reflected in Groensteen’s types of ‘arthrology’ across a linear sequence or disparate panels in a broader text (Groensteen 1999).},

According to the principle of the Five Ws, a report can only be considered complete if it answers these questions starting with an interrogative word:
Who
What
When
Where
WhySome authors add a sixth question, how, to the list:
HowEach question should have a factual answer — facts necessary to include for a report to be considered complete.  Importantly, none of these questions can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no".
In the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland), the Five Ws are used in Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 lessons (ages 7-14).},

An overall positive effect of animation over static graphics was found, with a Hedges’s g effect size of 0.226 (95\% conﬁdence interval ¼ 0.12e0.33). Additional moderator analyses indicated substantial effect sizes when the animation was system-paced (g ¼ 0.309), when it was coupled with auditory commentary (g ¼ 0.336) or when the instruction did not include any accompanying text (g ¼ 0.883).},
