# Conclusions and future work

In the present work we have asked if animated transitions help readers understand transitions in narrative visualization. 

We have found that none of the existing literature proposes a concept of how readers might readers interpret transitions in narrative visualization. We have addressed this gap in chapter [-@sec:perception-oriented] by reconceptualizing three existing views with a focus on narrative visualization. We have successfully applied this reconceptualization to examples from practice which has resulted in the identification of 9 transition types. These types map well to classifications that have been proposed by other authors (see section [-@sec:existing]) and clarify them. A future study should explore this formulation more in-depth. First, it should further research how well the *character*-metaphor represents how readers truly interpret narrative visualization. This might also lead to additional hints on *congruent* animation. Second, it should examine if and how the amount of change in *characters*, *attributes* and *context* is related to the difficulty of a transition. This might lead to a more formal definition of the *transition cost* ([@sec:transition-cost]). Such a definition would be highly useful for designers. They could use it to keep the *transition cost* within certain boundaries and ensure that a majority of readers would understand the stories presented. 

In our review of the literature on animation ([@sec:animation]) we have discussed the *congruence* and the *apprehension*-principle. The existing research indicates that *congruence* is much more important in practice than *apprehension*.  While techniques that aim to increase apprehension often fail, animations that are close to the movement of objects in real world consistently improve understanding. A future study should clarify how these two principles are linked to different levels of human perception. This would support designers in deciding when animation is useful and when it should be avoided.

The results of our experiment indicate that animated transitions do not support readers in understanding transitions. This answers the main research question and confirms previous findings [@Berney-16:doesanimation]. But we have found in many discussions that it is rather unintuitive for visualization designers. It is therefore clear that these findings might be criticized based on weaknesses in the research method. The discussion of the limitations ([@sec:limitations]) gives many indications on how a better experiment could be designed. Especially, by considering the different transition types and how they can benefit from different strengths of animation ([@sec:implications]). We plan to implement and conduct such an experiment in the future. 

We were also surprised to find how little evidence there was in visualization research for the claim that animation increases engagement. While our results support previous research [@Amini-18:hookeddata], much more work is needed to get a clear picture. Especially, visualization researchers should include validated scales for engagement more often in their studies.

Finally, we have presented a syntax to define animated transitions declaratively. The strength of our approach is that it is directly linked to the conceptual understanding and the transition types presented in chapter [-@sec:perception-oriented]. It is therefore directly applicable to the design of narrative visualization. If future research would find that animated transitions provide benefits for certain transition types, our work on declaratively defining transitions therefore has potential. Because it's syntax is inspired by the very popular Vega-Lite [@Satyanarayan-16:vegalitegrammar], it might be adapted to integrate into Vega-Lite as a plugin. This would make it easy to link two charts defined in Vega-Lite via an animated transition. This would result in a useful design tool for narrative visualization.
