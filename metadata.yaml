   The present work researches how animation can support the interpretation of transitions in narrative visualizations. In narrative visualization charts are arranged in sequential order to make it easier for readers to process the information. But the sequential presentation introduces the difficulty that readers need to understand how subsequent charts are related. We show they do this by comparing elements from the individual charts. We identify 9 types of transitions that are typically used in practice by asking which of the elements change and how they change between two charts. We then link these transition types to the strengths of animation that are often cited in literature. These indicate that animation might support  understanding by providing *object constancy*, *explicitly showing complex relationship*s and *highlighting* important elements. We conducted an experiment with 56 participants to test wether animated transitions led to a better *understanding* in general, to higher *engagement* and if the three strengths described above surfaced. We have found that while animated transitions supported *object constancy* and *highlighting*, the participants overall understanding was not better. Also animated transitions did not imply *relationships* nor did they lead to higher *engagement*. These findings indicate that transitions between charts are interpreted at the conceptual level. For the experiment we have built a software library that allows the rapid creation of narrative visualization with animated transitions based on a declarative syntax which is also described in the last part.
