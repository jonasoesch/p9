abstract: |
  The research on data visualization has traditionally focused on maximizing the throughput of information through the reader's visual system. This is useful for researchers who need to explore large amounts of data but it is very strenous. Narrative visualization on the other hand is a new approach to visualization that uses storytelling techniques to reduce the mental burden of the reader. One of these techniques is to guide the reader by organizing multiple charts in a sequential, narrative order. While this type of presentation splits information processing into managemable chunks, the reader now needs to understand how the individual charts are related. In practice, animated transitions are often used for this. But existing research indicates that animation might not be an effective way to present abstract relationships. This thesis aims to find out if animated transitions have a positive impact the readers understanding of narrative visualization.

    Based on a review of the literature on transition understanding and animation, we interoduce the concept of *characters* to narrative visualization. We propose that readers understand transitions by comparing how characters and their setting changes between two charts. The strenghts of animation were evaluated based on how they would serve this process. This has led to the formulation of several hypotheses.

    An experiment presented 8 transitions, half of them animated, to 56 participants to test these hypotheses. The results indicate that, while some of the strengths of animation are present, they do not translate to a higher overall understanding of the transitions when they were animated. They thus confirm existing research on the use of animation within the context of narrative visualization.
